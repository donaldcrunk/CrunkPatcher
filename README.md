# CrunkPatcher 1.0

Welcome! CrunkPatcher 1.0 is a simply piece of python code that generates & displays a random 'patch' for you to replicate on your synthesizer. This version is specifically intended for use with the MakeNoise 0-coast, however other synthesizers can be randomized simply by replacing the hard coded ins and outs of the 0-coast with your own device.

This project was inspired by Tom Whitwell's excellent article on using python for musical determinations: https://medium.com/music-thing-modular-notes/how-i-recorded-an-album-in-an-evening-with-a-lunchbox-modular-and-a-python-script-443ca08f34da

To use CrunkPatcher 1.0, Python version 3 must be installed on your computer. Visit https://www.python.org/getit/ and download the latest version of Python 3 for your operating system. 

Once installed, you may either run CrunkPatcher from the command line of your Mac or Windows computer, or simply double-click the file and tell your computer to use 'Python' to open the file.
